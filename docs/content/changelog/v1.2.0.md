- Replace default type resolution - Now it will not use the `reflect` _package by default_.
- Add `UseReflectionType` option in `Config` struct
- Improve tests coverage
    - Add test to check type resolution for elements with same _type-name_ and _package-name_ from another module
- Fix `GetElemKey` method not being able to get the type of the interface
- Fix an error where `interface` and `pointer` of the same type were being registered as the same type
- Create additional `"Do"` methods: **DoGet**, **DoGetGen**, **DoGetGenFunc**
- Refactor the **Storage/Injector** retrieval to return an `error` instead of a `bool`
