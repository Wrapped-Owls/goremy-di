### Fixed

- **Pointer type duck typing assertion**: Fixed an issue where pointer types (e.g., `*GoLanguage`) registered as binds
  could not be correctly asserted to interfaces (e.g., `Language`) when using duck typing. Previously,
  `checkSavedAsBind` was only using `PointerValue()`, which for pointer types like `*GoLanguage` would return
  `**GoLanguage` (a double pointer) that cannot be asserted to the `Language` interface. The function now first checks
  `DefaultValue()` for type assertion, and if that fails, it falls back to `PointerValue()` which correctly returns a
  pointer that can be asserted to the interface. This ensures that pointer types can be properly retrieved via duck
  typing when searching for interface implementations.
