- Replace internal type detection
    - Stop using `fmt.Sprintf` which uses reflection by default
    - Optimize existent function `TypeNameByReflection`
    - Add **0-width** generic type that will be used as key for injections
- Change `BindKey` type to any
- Upgrade minimal go-version to _1.20_
    - This was made to be able to use any as comparable
- Remove `GenerifyInterfaces=true` from default injector Config
