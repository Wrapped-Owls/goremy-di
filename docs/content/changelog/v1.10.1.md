### Fixed

- **Sub-injector GetAll delegation**: Fixed an issue where sub-injectors (created via `GetWith` or `GetWithPairs`) could
  not use duck typing to find interfaces from parent injectors when the sub-injector didn't have `CacheOptReturnAll`
  enabled. The `GetAll` method now correctly ignores `ErrConfigNotAllowReturnAll` for sub-injectors and delegates to the
  parent injector, allowing duck typing to work correctly even when the sub-injector's storage doesn't allow GetAll
  operations.
