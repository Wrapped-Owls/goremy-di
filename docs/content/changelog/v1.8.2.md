- Update `GetAll` method (and also duck type get) to retrieve objects stored as **Bind[T]**
    - This update add a little more overhead to check if the bind implements the type we're searching for
    - Created a new function on Binds to try to prevent stack-overflow and cycle dependency get
    - If everything matches, this new way of returning duck-type elements will call the Generate method on bind
        - It must be very careful about cycle dependencies now more than ever
- Add tests to cover the new duckType mode with `Bind[T]`
- Add new functions to register constructors with the injector.
    - `RegisterConstructor` - `RegisterConstructorErr`
    - `RegisterConstructorArgs1` - `RegisterConstructorArgs1Err`
    - `RegisterConstructorArgs2` - `RegisterConstructorArgs2Err`
- Add tests to cover new constructor registration.
