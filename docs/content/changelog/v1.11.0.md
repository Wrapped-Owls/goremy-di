### Breaking Changes

- **Removed reflection options from Config**: The `Config` struct no longer includes `GenerifyInterfaces` and `UseReflectionType` fields. These options have been completely removed from the library as part of a simplification effort.
- **Removed ReflectionOptions type**: The `ReflectionOptions` type has been removed. All reflection-based functionality has been eliminated in favor of compile-time type safety.
- **GetWithPairs API change**: `GetWithPairs` now uses the new `BindEntry` interface instead of `InstancePairAny`. The parameter order has also changed: `keyTag` is now the second parameter (before `elements`).
  - **Before**: `GetWithPairs[T](retriever, elements []InstancePairAny, optTag ...string)`
  - **After**: `GetWithPairs[T](retriever, elements []BindEntry, optTag ...string)`
- **GetWith parameter order change**: The `keyTag` parameter is now required and comes before the `binder` function parameter in internal methods. The public API maintains backward compatibility with optional tags.
- **Removed deprecated functions**: The `remy_deprecated.go` file and all deprecated function wrappers have been removed. If you were using deprecated functions, you must migrate to the new API.

### Added

- **BindEntry interface**: New interface for passing temporary dependencies to `GetWithPairs`. Provides a cleaner, type-safe API compared to the previous `InstancePairAny` struct.
  - `NewBindEntry[T](value T) BindEntry`: Creates a `BindEntry` with the given value and no tag
  - `NewBindEntryTagged[T](value T, tag string) BindEntry`: Creates a `BindEntry` with the given value and tag
- **Improved type key generation**: Enhanced `KeyElem` with better ID generation using unsafe pointers for improved performance.

### Changed / Improved

- **Internal method signatures**: All internal injector methods now use `keyTag string` instead of `optTag ...string` for better clarity and consistency. The public API maintains backward compatibility.
- **Storage key validation**: Storage now properly validates and checks for empty keys, preventing potential issues with uninitialized bind keys.
- **Performance improvements**: Storage access has been optimized using unsafe pointers for better performance.

### Refactor

- **Removed reflection dependencies**: All reflection-based type key generation and type identification has been removed from the core library, improving compile-time safety and performance.
- **Simplified injector configuration**: The `Config` struct is now simpler and more focused, removing complex reflection options that were rarely needed.
- **Updated examples**: All examples have been updated to use the new `BindEntry` API and no longer reference reflection options.

### Tests

- Updated all injector tests to include `keyTag` in internal method calls
- Added tests for the new `BindEntry` API
- Tests adapted to work without reflection options
