// This bind type has no protection over concurrency, so it's not recommended to be used a struct that performs some
// operation that will modify its attributes.

// This bind don't hold any object or pointer references, and will use the given types.Binder function everytime to
// generate a new instance of the requested type.
//
// As this bind doesn't hold any pointer and/or objects, there is no problem to use it in multiples goroutines at once.
// Just be careful with calls of the DependencyRetriever,
// if try to get and modify values from an Instance bind, it can end in a race-condition.
